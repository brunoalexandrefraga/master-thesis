  abstract = {Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 11e, like its predecessors, is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, whose interest in differential equations may sometimes be quite theoretical, sometimes intensely practical, and often somewhere in between. The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two or three semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.},

  abstract = {As stated in the introductory section, DDR signaling has evolved tremendously over the last two decades, leading to diversification not only in the architecture of the memory array but also in that of the interface. Application-specific channels have influenced the I/O design nearly as much as system power and bandwidth requirements have. The growing impact of the multidrop server channel, along with a broad range of target environments, has led the DDR branch to incorporate multitap DFE, while shrinking supply voltages to facilitate low-power operation led LPDDR to completely rethink the output driver structure. At the same time, GDDR has reached speeds requiring nearly equal care of the external channel and the chip itself. With all these adaptations and many others not captured here, the broader DDR family looks to continue to push the boundaries of single ended signaling into the future. For additional details, see the perspective on the DRAM interface.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of noise analysis of phase-locked loops (PLLs). The problem is formulated as a stochastic differential equation and is solved in the presence of circuit white noise sources yielding the spectrum of the PLL output. Specifically, the effect of loop filter characteristics, phase-frequency detector, and phase noise of the open-loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) on the PLL output spectrum is quantified. These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open-loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results; specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors. The PLL output spectrum computation only requires the phase noise of the VCO, loop filter and phase detector noise, phase detector gain, and loop filter transfer function and does not require the transient simulation of the entire PLL which can be very expensive. The noise analysis technique is illustrated with some examples.},

  abstract = {Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits by Behzad Razavi, deals with the analysis and design of analog CMOS integrated circuits, emphasizing fundamentals, as well as new paradigms that students and practicing engineers need to master in today's industry. Because analog design requires both intuition and rigor, each concept is first introduced from an intuitive perspective and subsequently treated by careful analysis. The objective is to develop both a solid foundation and methods of analyzing circuits by inspection so that the reader learns what approximations can be made in which circuits, and how much error to expect in each approximation. This approach also enables the reader to apply the concepts to bipolar circuits with little additional effort.},
