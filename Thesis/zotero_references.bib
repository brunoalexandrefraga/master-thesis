  abstract = {Fundamentals of Electric Circuits continues in the spirit of its successful previous editions, with the objective of presenting circuit analysis in a manner that is clearer, more interesting, and easier to understand than other, more traditional texts. Students are introduced to the sound, six-step problem solving methodology in chapter one, and are consistently made to apply and practice these steps in practice problems and homework problems throughout the text. A balance of theory, worked \& extended examples, practice problems, and real-world applications, combined with over 468 new or changed homework problems complete this edition. Robust media offerings, renders this text to be the most comprehensive and student-friendly approach to linear circuit analysis out there. This book retains the "Design a Problem" feature which helps students develop their design skills by having the student develop the question, as well as the solution. There are over 100 "Design a Problem" exercises integrated into problem sets in the book.McGraw-Hill's Connect, is also available as an optional, add on item. Connect is the only integrated learning system that empowers students by continuously adapting to deliver precisely what they need, when they need it, how they need it, so that class time is more effective. Connect allows the professor to assign homework, quizzes, and tests easily and automatically grades and records the scores of the student's work. Problems are randomized to prevent sharing of answers an may also have a "multi-step solution" which helps move the students' learning along if they experience difficulty.},

  abstract = {Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Value Problems 11e, like its predecessors, is written from the viewpoint of the applied mathematician, whose interest in differential equations may sometimes be quite theoretical, sometimes intensely practical, and often somewhere in between. The authors have sought to combine a sound and accurate (but not abstract) exposition of the elementary theory of differential equations with considerable material on methods of solution, analysis, and approximation that have proved useful in a wide variety of applications. While the general structure of the book remains unchanged, some notable changes have been made to improve the clarity and readability of basic material about differential equations and their applications. In addition to expanded explanations, the 11th edition includes new problems, updated figures and examples to help motivate students. The program is primarily intended for undergraduate students of mathematics, science, or engineering, who typically take a course on differential equations during their first or second year of study. The main prerequisite for engaging with the program is a working knowledge of calculus, gained from a normal two or three semester course sequence or its equivalent. Some familiarity with matrices will also be helpful in the chapters on systems of differential equations.},

  abstract = {Currently, we are living in a data-centric era as the need for large amounts of data has dramatically increased due to the widespread adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) in a variety of technology domains. In the current computing architecture, the memory input and output (I/O) bandwidth is becoming a bottleneck for improving computing performance; therefore, high-bandwidth memory interfaces are essential. In addition, the high power consumption of data centers to edge AI devices will lead to power shortages and climate crises in the near future; therefore, energy-efficient techniques for memory interfaces are also important. This article presents contemporary approaches to improve I/O bandwidth, such as increasing the I/O pin count and data rate/pin, and to save energy in memory interfaces. However, there are still some design challenges that require further improvements. Therefore, various design challenges and problems to be solved are discussed, and future perspectives, including chiplet and die-to-die interfaces, are presented. Based on various research and development efforts to overcome the current limitations, the technological paradigm shift and related industries are expected to advance to the next level.},

  abstract = {A new frequency synthesis technique is proposed that eliminates trade-off dilemma between small settling time and good resolution, ideal for fast frequency hopping systems. The frequency synthesizer is based on a PLL that employs a digital phase accumulator that has the property to calculate the phase difference of the two different input frequencies (reference frequency and output frequency), at the maximum possible rate. This digital phase accumulator normalizes the phase increments of the two input frequencies by multiplying the phase, instead of dividing the frequency, as done in the traditional PLL based frequency synthesizer. Therefore, the sampling rate of the phase of each frequency is not reduced down to the step frequency of the synthesizer, but is as high as the reference and the output frequencies. This results in an output from the digital phase accumulator which has harmonics at high frequencies which can be cut-off by a wide bandwidth LPF. As a result, the settling time of the synthesizer is independent of the frequency step, corresponding to the resolution, and can be reduced dramatically compared to the settling time achieved by a high resolution ordinary PLL based frequency synthesizer.},

It has been observed that different types of PLL have different performance parameters and response time. The basic operation of Phase Locked Loop is to track the output signal and compare it with the input signal so that voltage controlled oscillator (VCO) maintains a constant phase angle with the reference input signal. The accuracy level and noise immunity changes for different types of Phase locked loops. Final conclusion has been made between these two PLLs based on results observed and suitable areas of applications are suggested based on its performance.},

  abstract = {As stated in the introductory section, DDR signaling has evolved tremendously over the last two decades, leading to diversification not only in the architecture of the memory array but also in that of the interface. Application-specific channels have influenced the I/O design nearly as much as system power and bandwidth requirements have. The growing impact of the multidrop server channel, along with a broad range of target environments, has led the DDR branch to incorporate multitap DFE, while shrinking supply voltages to facilitate low-power operation led LPDDR to completely rethink the output driver structure. At the same time, GDDR has reached speeds requiring nearly equal care of the external channel and the chip itself. With all these adaptations and many others not captured here, the broader DDR family looks to continue to push the boundaries of single ended signaling into the future.

``From an interconnect perspective, DDR5 may find itself signaling across a short and benign channel in a variety of applications, including data buffer-ing in an SSD, but is more likely to find itself mounted to a dual inline memory module (DIMM) inserted into one of multiple connectors on a high-capacity server motherboard. The most common system configu-ration is the two DIMM-per-channel, dual-rank (two loads per DIMM), in which each of two DIMMs is config-ured to connect two DRAM loads per wire, with both DIMMs connected to the same controller channel, for a total of four loads.''

  abstract = {This paper presents a transmitter with a phase controller for low switching noise injection and a quadrature clock corrector (QCC) for correcting both phase error and duty cycle distortion of the divided quadrature clocks. The phase errors and the duty cycle distortions of the quadrature clocks determine the quality of the output DQS. The proposed QCC simultaneously runs phase correction and the duty adjustment of quadrature clocks for fast correction time. In order to reduce power switching noise induced by output drivers, the proposed transmitter transfers the data at different timings using the phase controller which generates the interpolated quadrature clocks for even and odd channels. Since the even channel is synchronized with the reference quadrature clocks and the odd channel is synchronized with the interpolated quadrature clocks, the peak switching currents consumed by output drivers are spread. The proposed circuit has been designed in 180-nm CMOS process using VDD of 1.8-V and VDDQ of 0.6-V and the target data rate is 3.2 Gbps. The corrected quadrature clocks have the duty cycle distortion of 0.2\% and the phase error of 1.18{$^\circ$} with input clock distortion. The output DQS of the transmitter shows the peak-to-peak jitter of 30.55-ps in the low switching noise injection mode with the phase offset of 122{$^\circ$}, which is improved by 28.8\% as compared to the normal mode.},

  abstract = {The terms hold-in, pull-in (capture), and lock-in ranges are widely used by engineers for the concepts of frequency deviation ranges within which PLL-based circuits can achieve lock under various additional conditions. Usually only non-strict definitions are given for these concepts in engineering literature. After many years of their usage, F. Gardner in the 2nd edition of his well-known work, Phaselock Techniques, wrote ``There is no natural way to define exactly any unique lock-in frequency'' and ``despite its vague reality, lock-in range is a useful concept.'' Recently these observations have led to the following advice given in a handbook on synchronization and communications: ``We recommend that you check these definitions carefully before using them.'' In this survey an attempt is made to discuss and fill some of the gaps identified between mathematical control theory, the theory of dynamical systems and the engineering practice of phase-locked loops. It is shown that, from a mathematical point of view, in some cases the hold-in and pull-in ``ranges'' may not be the intervals of values but a union of intervals and thus their widely used definitions require clarification. Rigorous mathematical definitions for the hold-in, pull-in, and lock-in ranges are given. An effective solution for the problem on the unique definition of the lock-in frequency, posed by Gardner, is suggested.},

The most representative example of digital assistance is the compensation of the nonlinearity of an analog block, which is done by applying the digital inverse of the nonlinearity at the output. However, as the digital inverse is not known a priori, it has to be estimated, and the estimation needs to adapt in the background to the environmental conditions. This is typically accomplished by relying on adaptive filtering, i.e., by closing a system-identification engine in feedback that injects a modulation at the input of the nonlinear block. This article, after reviewing the basics of both PLLs and adaptive filters, will explore the most significant calibrations adopted in PLLs.},

The proposed Linear Range Extensible PFD and CP (LRE-PFDCP) can minimize the impact of non-ideal effects caused by the limited linear range of the Conventional PFD and CP (C-PFDCP). Thus, the frequency acquisition time of the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) implemented with LRE-PFDCP can be significantly reduced during large frequency hopping. Unlike other linear range extension techniques, the proposed LRE-PFDCP is robust and does not cause PLL unlocking. The proposed LRE-PFDCP together with a prototype PLL is designed and simulated in a 0.18{$\mu$}m CMOS process. Simulation results show that the PLL achieves 320MHz frequency hopping within 4{$\mu$}s, which is about 3.25 times faster than the same PLL with linear range extension disabled.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of noise analysis of phase-locked loops (PLLs). The problem is formulated as a stochastic differential equation and is solved in the presence of circuit white noise sources yielding the spectrum of the PLL output. Specifically, the effect of loop filter characteristics, phase-frequency detector, and phase noise of the open-loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) on the PLL output spectrum is quantified. These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open-loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results; specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors. The PLL output spectrum computation only requires the phase noise of the VCO, loop filter and phase detector noise, phase detector gain, and loop filter transfer function and does not require the transient simulation of the entire PLL which can be very expensive. The noise analysis technique is illustrated with some examples.},

At higher offset frequencies (outside the loop bandwidth), this noise is suppressed as the loop prevents the VCO from following these changes in phase. Also note that the division ratio plays a very important part in this transfer function. It can be seen that, at low reference frequencies, where the s and s2 terms in (3.78) can be ignored relative to the constant terms, a higher division ratio N directly results in higher phase noise.

With most of the approaches having been developed through years of experience, this completely practical guide explores methods for achieving the locked state in a variety of conditions as it examines:Performance limitations of phase/frequency detector--based phase locked loopsThe quadricorrelator method for both continuous and sampled modesSawtooth ramp-and-sample phase detector and how its waveform contains frequency error information that can be extractedThe benefits of a self-sweeping, self-extinguishing topologySweep methods using quadrature mixer-based lock detectionThe use of digital implementations versus analogFrequency Acquisition Techniques for Phase Locked Loops is an important resource for RF/microwave engineers, in particular, circuit designers; practicing electronics engineers involved in frequency synthesis, phase locked loops, carrier or clock recovery loops, radio-frequency integrated circuit design, and aerospace electronics; and managers wanting to understand the technology of phase locked loops and frequency acquisition assistance techniques or jitter attenuating loops.

  abstract = {This article presents a very sophisticated subclass of communication subsystems, namely oscillators, that use the phase-locked loop (PLL) technique. Some basic features and several application examples are presented that enable locking in the oscillator signal for each frequency offset. If the oscillator is used on its fundamental frequency, a high spectral purity is achieved without additional distortion. Furthermore, it can be increased by the filter function of the loop. An integrated 70 GHz synthesizer is introduced and discussed, and a microwave synthesizer module and its technical behavior is described. Several measured results supported by analytical considerations show the applicability and the high performance of the PLLs introduced.},

The equation is applied to a typical third-order loop, and algebraic results are derived in terms of the loop dc gain and network break frequencies. Expressions are given for the second-order terms which are usually neglected, so that an evaluation of the accuracy of results can be made.},
