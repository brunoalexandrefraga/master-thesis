  abstract = {As stated in the introductory section, DDR signaling has evolved tremendously over the last two decades, leading to diversification not only in the architecture of the memory array but also in that of the interface. Application-specific channels have influenced the I/O design nearly as much as system power and bandwidth requirements have. The growing impact of the multidrop server channel, along with a broad range of target environments, has led the DDR branch to incorporate multitap DFE, while shrinking supply voltages to facilitate low-power operation led LPDDR to completely rethink the output driver structure. At the same time, GDDR has reached speeds requiring nearly equal care of the external channel and the chip itself. With all these adaptations and many others not captured here, the broader DDR family looks to continue to push the boundaries of single ended signaling into the future. For additional details, see the perspective on the DRAM interface.},

  abstract = {This work addresses the problem of noise analysis of phase-locked loops (PLLs). The problem is formulated as a stochastic differential equation and is solved in the presence of circuit white noise sources yielding the spectrum of the PLL output. Specifically, the effect of loop filter characteristics, phase-frequency detector, and phase noise of the open-loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) on the PLL output spectrum is quantified. These results are derived using a full nonlinear analysis of the VCO in the feedback loop and cannot be predicted using traditional linear analyses or the phase noise analysis of open-loop oscillators. The computed spectrum matches well with measured results; specifically, the shape of the output spectrum matches very well with measured PLL output spectra reported in the literature for different kinds of loop filters and phase detectors. The PLL output spectrum computation only requires the phase noise of the VCO, loop filter and phase detector noise, phase detector gain, and loop filter transfer function and does not require the transient simulation of the entire PLL which can be very expensive. The noise analysis technique is illustrated with some examples.},
