  abstract = {As stated in the introductory section, DDR signaling has evolved tremendously over the last two decades, leading to diversification not only in the architecture of the memory array but also in that of the interface. Application-specific channels have influenced the I/O design nearly as much as system power and bandwidth requirements have. The growing impact of the multidrop server channel, along with a broad range of target environments, has led the DDR branch to incorporate multitap DFE, while shrinking supply voltages to facilitate low-power operation led LPDDR to completely rethink the output driver structure. At the same time, GDDR has reached speeds requiring nearly equal care of the external channel and the chip itself. With all these adaptations and many others not captured here, the broader DDR family looks to continue to push the boundaries of single ended signaling into the future. For additional details, see the perspective on the DRAM interface.},

  abstract = {Design of Analog CMOS Integrated Circuits by Behzad Razavi, deals with the analysis and design of analog CMOS integrated circuits, emphasizing fundamentals, as well as new paradigms that students and practicing engineers need to master in today's industry. Because analog design requires both intuition and rigor, each concept is first introduced from an intuitive perspective and subsequently treated by careful analysis. The objective is to develop both a solid foundation and methods of analyzing circuits by inspection so that the reader learns what approximations can be made in which circuits, and how much error to expect in each approximation. This approach also enables the reader to apply the concepts to bipolar circuits with little additional effort.},

  abstract = {Using a modern, pedagogical approach, this textbook gives students and engineers a comprehensive and rigorous knowledge of CMOS phase-locked loop (PLL) design for a wide range of applications. It features intuitive presentation of theoretical concepts, built up gradually from their simplest form to more practical systems; broad coverage of key topics, including oscillators, phase noise, analog PLLs, digital PLLs, RF synthesizers, delay-locked loops, clock and data recovery circuits, and frequency dividers; tutorial chapters on high-performance oscillator design, covering fundamentals to advanced topologies; and extensive use of circuit simulations to teach design mentality, highlight design flaws, and connect theory with practice. Including over 200 thought-provoking examples highlighting best practices and common pitfalls, 250 end-of-chapter homework problems to test and enhance the readers' understanding, and solutions and lecture slides for instructors, this is the perfect text for senior undergraduate and graduate-level students and professional engineers who want an in-depth understanding of PLL design.},

  abstract = {Frequency synthesizers are used in everything from wireless and wireline communications to waveform generation, but until now circuit design expertise in this area has been scattered in numerous trade publications and papers. This one-stop resource gives circuit designers all the straight-from-the-lab techniques, procedures, and applications they need for their work in the field. Following an introduction to system architecture and behavioural analysis, the book provides an extensive treatment of circuit implementation, emphasizing analog synthesizers and direct digital synthesizers and their applications. Worked and simulated examples throughout provide professionals with field-tested analyses, design approaches, and problem-solving strategies.},
