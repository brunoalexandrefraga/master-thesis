## ‚úçÔ∏è Core Idea  
A clear sentence that summarizes the central insight or purpose of the note.  
> *Example:* The transfer function of a basic Integer-N PLL can be expressed as a first-order system.

---

## üß© Development

### 1. Context  
Brief description of the system, circuit, or problem being analyzed.  
> *Example:* Linearized model of an Integer-N PLL for frequency-domain analysis.

### 2. Derivation / Analysis  
As was gotten in [[Critical value at which the reference period (low frequency) cannot achieve to make the system unstable, making any pole move outside the unit circle]],
$$
\begin{split}
T&=\frac{1}{\omega_n\zeta}\implies\\
\end{split}
$$
Where $T$ is the period of the reference signal of angular frequency $\omega$. This way, it's also true that
$$
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$
So,
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{1}{\omega_n\zeta}
$$
The relationship becomes,
$$
\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}\ge2\pi\zeta
$$

### 3. Example (optional)  
Include a practical case, numerical example, or simulation result to reinforce understanding.
