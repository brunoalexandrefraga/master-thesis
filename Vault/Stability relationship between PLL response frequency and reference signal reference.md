 
As was gotten in [[Critical value at which the reference period (low frequency) cannot achieve to make the system unstable, making any pole move outside the unit circle]],
$$
\begin{split}
T&=\frac{1}{\omega_n\zeta}\implies\\
\end{split}
$$
Where $T$ is the period of the reference signal of angular frequency $\omega$. This way, it's also true that
$$
T=\frac{2\pi}{\omega}
$$
So,
$$
\frac{2\pi}{\omega}=\frac{1}{\omega_n\zeta}
$$
The relationship becomes,
$$
\frac{\omega}{\omega_n}\ge2\pi\zeta
$$
