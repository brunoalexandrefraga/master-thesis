## ✍️ Core Idea  
A clear sentence that summarizes the central insight or purpose of the note.  
> *Example:* The transfer function of a basic Integer-N PLL can be expressed as a first-order system.

---

## 🧩 Development

### 1. Context  
Brief description of the system, circuit, or problem being analyzed.  
> *Example:* Linearized model of an Integer-N PLL for frequency-domain analysis.

### 2. Derivation / Analysis  
The phase of a frequency step, $\Delta\omega$, can be expressed as
$$
\theta_R=\frac{\Delta\omega}{s^2}
$$



### 3. Example (optional)  
Include a practical case, numerical example, or simulation result to reinforce understanding.
