## ✍️ Core Idea  
A clear sentence that summarizes the central insight or purpose of the note.  
> *Example:* The transfer function of a basic Integer-N PLL can be expressed as a first-order system.

---

## 🧩 Development

### 1. Context  
Brief description of the system, circuit, or problem being analyzed.  
> *Example:* Linearized model of an Integer-N PLL for frequency-domain analysis.

### 2. Derivation / Analysis  
Step-by-step derivation of the equation, with explanatory comments.

$$
H(s) = \frac{\theta_{out}(s)}{\theta_{ref}(s)} = \frac{K_{PD} \cdot K_{VCO}}{s + K_{PD} \cdot K_{VCO}}
$$

> You may include diagrams, links to supporting notes, or intermediate results.

### 3. Example (optional)  
Include a practical case, numerical example, or simulation result to reinforce understanding.
