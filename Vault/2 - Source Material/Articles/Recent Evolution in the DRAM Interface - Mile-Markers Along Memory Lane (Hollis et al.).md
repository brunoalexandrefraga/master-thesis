- `In addition, DDR systems tend to be more nonlinear than traditional SerDes systems, as a result of trans-mitter output impedance variation over the operating range, mismatch between pull-up (PU) and pull-down (PD) impedances, and distinct rise and fall behaviors.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 10) Important.
- `While LPDDR1 was essentially a DDR1 with a lowered supply level, over the generations, LPDDR has incorporated a variety of features and functions, including a suite of new modes of operation, to facilitate generally lower power.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 10) Important.
- `The DDR5 driver exhib-its nonlinear behavior because of the limited voltage headroom at the lower, 1.05-V VDDQ level. In contrast, LPDDR5 exhibits good linearity, despite a VDDQ of 0.5 V [4], which is interest-ing, given the expected drive limita-tions of the NMOS PU device unique to the LVSTL architecture.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 11) Important.
- `Thus, as indicated previously with respect to Figure 4, LPDDR5 signaling is not inherently impeded by chan-nel impairments, although applica-tions that increase system memory by connecting multiple DRAMs in par-allel tend to degrade SI through the additive channel loading and amp-lified reflections from the larger effective capacitive input.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 11) Important.
- `While the graphics DRAM architecture has traditionally served gaming and high-performance computing, the ongoing explosion of data associated with AI and ML has dramatically broadened the application space for GDDR.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 12) Important.

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `DBI provides a relatively simple and low-overhead approach to cut the instantaneous current in half while also lowering the average I/O current, although to a lesser degree.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 17)
	
- `However, because of the narrow-band nature of the forwarded clock, it is still possible to distribute the data-latching clock to each data pad and capture the data immediately as they enter the DRAM.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 17)
	
- `Loss of high-speed noise and jitter correlation, resulting from the unmatched paths, is much less a problem than the data-dependent jitter incurred along the on-die, bandwidth-limited data path of the earlier source-synchronous architecture.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 17)
	
- `From an interconnect perspective, DDR5 may find itself signaling across a short and benign channel in a variety of applications, including data buffer-ing in an SSD, but is more likely to find itself mounted to a dual inline memory module (DIMM) inserted into one of multiple connectors on a high-capacity server motherboard. The most common system configu-ration is the two DIMM-per-channel, dual-rank (two loads per DIMM), in which each of two DIMMs is config-ured to connect two DRAM loads per wire, with both DIMMs connected to the same controller channel, for a total of four loads.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 5)
	
- `The basic structure of Figure 11lends itself to scaling, but support for an odd number of taps is awkward and inefficient` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 9)
	
- `time-varying impair-ments` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 10)
	Which one?
- `Note that the gates of the output stage would continue to be driven between VSS and VDD2 (1.1 V), resulting in more than enough over-drive voltage V GS across the NMOS PU to support a clean low-to-high transi-tion, even at the upper half of the sig-nal range (0.3–0.6 V).` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 11)
	
- `The shaded regions represent the typical operating range establish-ed by the dc voltage divider formed between the output impedance (drive strength) and the termination at the far end of the channel (although no termination was included in these simulations).` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 11)
	
- `16 Gb/s pulse responses` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 12)
	[[16-Gb/s pulse response]]
- `FIGURE 19: A 16-Gb/s pulse response comparison with and without via back-drilling, demonstrating the distinct compensation provided by DFE and back-drilling.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 12)
	[[16-Gb/s pulse response comparison with and without back-drilling interpretation]].
- `The GDDR5 and GDDR5X stan-dards did something unique when specifying the output drive strength and input termination values of the I/O. Rather than leave the drive and on-die termination (ODT) flex-ible, as in the DDR and LPDDR stan-dards, which allow for driver and ODT adjustment through enabling/ disabling combinations of calibrated 240-Ω PU and PD legs (seven legs for DDR5 and six legs for LPDDR5), the recent graphics standards fixed the drive strength and ODT settings [29], [30].` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 13)
	
- `As mentioned previously and shown in Figure 15, the swing of the transmit-ted signal in the GDDR topology is a function of the driver PD and the ODT. Thus, the PU/PD drive-strength ratio of 60 Ω/40 Ω, coupled with the 60-Ω ODT to VDDQ at the far end of the channel, increased the avail-able signal window by 135 mV over a 50-Ω/50-Ω solution.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 13)
	
- `Using the traditional dog-bone layout approach, it is possible to separate the majority of the vertical transitions while introducing power and ground signal return vias between the signal vias for dramatically improved SI.` (Hollis et al., 2019, p. 15)
