## 🔗 Notes (Zotero)
### 💡 Technical concepts
- `cycle slipping` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76)
	[[Cycle slipping]] - Nonlinear event that a loop experiences when an event at the input occurs that causes the phase error to exceed 2\pi.
- `acquisition mode` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76)
	[[Acquisition mode]] - Loop (PLL) working to correct the phase and force the VCO to track the input.

### ✅️ Important
- `However,the behavior of a real PLL is much more complex than either of these two analysescan explain. This is because, until the loop starts tracking the phase of the input, or, alternatively, if there is a very large step or ramp in the phase of the input, theloop's output phase may not be able to follow the input phase. This is primarilydue to the limitations of the phase detector, which has a narrow linear range.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `If an event at the input occursthat causes the phase error to exceed 2p, then the loop will experience a nonlinear event: cycle slipping.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `Remember that in the previous analysis, it was assumed thatthe phase detector was linear.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `This nonlinear event will cause a transient responsethat cannot be predicted by the theory of the previous section.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `When the loop goes into this process, it is said to be in acquisition mode as it istrying to acquire phase lock but has not done so yet.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `Note that acquisition alsohappens when the PLL is first powered since the VCO and reference will be at a random phase and will probably have a frequency difference.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76) Important.
- `For linear transient behavior, the phase error, rather than the output phase, is needed` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 77)

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `Forexample, the tristate PFD has a linear range of ±2p.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76)
	[[Linear range of a tristate PFD]].
- `In extreme cases,the VCO may even be forced beyond its linear range of operation, which may result in the loop losing lock indefinitely.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 76)
	[[Extreme cases that forces VCO beyond its linear range of operation and the loop lose lock indefinitely]].
