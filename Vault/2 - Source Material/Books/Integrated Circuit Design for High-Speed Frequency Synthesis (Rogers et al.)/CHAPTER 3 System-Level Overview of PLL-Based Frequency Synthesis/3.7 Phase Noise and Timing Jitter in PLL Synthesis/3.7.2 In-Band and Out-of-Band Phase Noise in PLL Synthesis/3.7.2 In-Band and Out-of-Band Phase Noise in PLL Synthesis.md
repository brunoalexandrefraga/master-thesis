## 🔗 Notes (Zotero)
### 💡 Technical concepts


### ✅️ Important
- `The noise transfer functions for the various noise sources in the loop can be derived quite easily using the theory already presented. There are two noise transfer functions: one for the VCO and one for all other sources of noise in the loop.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `All noise generated by the PFD, charge pump, divider, and loop filter is referred back to the input` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `noise from the VCO is referred to the output` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `The transfer function for wnoise I (s) has already been derived` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93)
	[[Transfer function for noise from PFD, charge pump, divider and loop filter]].
- `transfer function for the noise due to the VCO is slightly different` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 94)
	[[Transfer function for noise from VCO]].

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `This is a lowpass function, which means that, for low frequencies (inside the loop bandwidth), the loop will track the input phase (which includes the phase noise); thus, this noise will be transferred to the output. At higher offset frequencies (outside the loop bandwidth), this noise is suppressed as the loop prevents the VCO from following these changes in phase. Also note that the division ratio plays a very important part in this transfer function. It can be seen that, at low reference frequencies, where the s and s2 terms in (3.78) can be ignored relative to the constant terms, a higher division ratio N directly results in higher phase noise. This is one of the strongest arguments for using fractional-N architectures in synthesizers, as, with large division ratios, it is hard to get low phase noise performance.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 94)
	
- `This is a highpass filter. Thus, at low offsets inside the loop bandwidth, the VCO noise is suppressed by the feedback action of the loop. Outside the loop bandwidth, however, the VCO is essentially free running; thus, the loop noise approaches the VCO noise.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 94)
