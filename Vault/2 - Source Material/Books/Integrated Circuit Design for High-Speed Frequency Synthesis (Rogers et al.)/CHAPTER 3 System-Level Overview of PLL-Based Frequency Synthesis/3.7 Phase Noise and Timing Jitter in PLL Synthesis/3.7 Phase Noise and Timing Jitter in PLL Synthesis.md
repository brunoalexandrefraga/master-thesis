## üîó Notes (Zotero)
### üí° Technical concepts
- `dBc` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Decibels relative to carrier]].
- `dBc/Hz` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Decibel relative to the carrier per Herz]].
- `power spectral density (PSD)` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[Power Spectral Density (PSD)]].

### ‚úÖÔ∏è Important
- `We are primarily concerned with noise that causes fluctuations in the phase of the output, rather than noise that causes amplitude fluctuations in the tone, since the output typically has a fixed, limited amplitude.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87) Important.
- `output signal of a synthesizer` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Generic output signal of a synthesizer with random fluctuations in the phase of the output]].
- `Phase noise is often quoted in units of dBc/Hz, while timing jitter is often quoted in units of picoseconds.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87) Important.
- `the phase noise in an oscillator, which is mainly due to thermal, flicker, or 1/f noise and the finite Q of the oscillator tank` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87) Important.
- `The phase fluctuation is assumed to have a sinusoidal` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Phase fluctuation equation]].
- `small phase fluctuation` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Small phase fluctuation equation in a PLL]].
- `often phase noise is reported relative to the carrier power` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[Typical expression for phase noise relative to the carrier power]].
- `In this form, phase noise has units of rad2/Hz.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `To further complicate this, both singlesideband (SSB) and double-sideband phase noise can be defined.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `SSB phase noise is defined as the ratio of power in one sideband per hertz of bandwidth, at an offset Dv away from the carrier, to the total signal power.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `The SSB phase noise power spectral density (PSD) to carrier ratio, in units of [dBc/Hz]` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[SSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]].
- `Note that SSB phase noise is by far the most common type reported, and, often, it is not specified as SSB but simply reported as phase noise.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89) Important.
- `double-sideband phase noise` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[DSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]].
- `From either the SSB or double-sideband phase noise, the rms jitter can be obtained as` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[Math definition of RMS jitter]].

### Ô∏èüî∂ Explanation
- `Synthesizer noise performance is usually classified in terms of phase noise` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 86)
	The phase noise is a measure of how much the output diverges from an ideal impulse function in the frequency domain.
- `The discrete spurs at a synthesizer output are most likely due to the fractional-N mechanism` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	Due to the existance of spurious tones to the nonlinearities, I guess.
- `It is now evident that the phase-modulated signal includes the carrier signal tone and two symmetric sidebands at any offset frequency` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[PLL phase-modulated signal including the carrier signal tone and two symmetric sidebands at any offset frequency]].
