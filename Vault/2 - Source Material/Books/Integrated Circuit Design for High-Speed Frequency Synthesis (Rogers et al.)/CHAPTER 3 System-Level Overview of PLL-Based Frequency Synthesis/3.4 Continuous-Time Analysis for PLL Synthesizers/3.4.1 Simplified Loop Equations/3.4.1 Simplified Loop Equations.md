### ✅️ Important
- `The natural frequency of the loop is given by` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 54)
	[[Natural frequency from second-order loop filter parameters]].
- `The damping constant is given by` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 54)
	[[Damping constant from second-order loop filter parameters]].
- `It is straightforward to solve these two equations for these variables` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 54)
	[[First capacitor of second-order loop filter from system parameters]].
- `and` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 54)
	[[Resistor of second-order loop filter from system parameters]].
- `From the above, it can be shown that (3.19) can be rewritten in a general form as` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 55)
	[[General equation for closed-loop PLL]].
- `For instance, it is often interesting to look at the control voltage going into the VCO.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 55)
	[[PLL transfer function of control vontage going into the VCO]].
