### ✅️ Important
- `From the above, it can be shown that (3.19) can be rewritten in a general form as` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 55)
	[[General equation for closed-loop PLL]].
- `For instance, it is often interesting to look at the control voltage going into the VCO.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 55)
	[[PLL transfer function of control vontage going into the VCO]].
