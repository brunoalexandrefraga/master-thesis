## üîó Notes (Zotero)
### üí° Technical concepts
- `loop bandwidth` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Loop bandwidth]] - Frequency range in which the loop can effectively follow the reference.
- `hold function` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Hold function]] - Process that maintains a signal or value for a certain period of time without change.
- `root locus` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Root locus]] -
- `unit circle` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Unit circle]].

### ‚úÖÔ∏è Important
- `The loop filter holds the charge dumped onto it in each cycle, so, in this system, it acts as a hold function.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58) Important.
- `open-loop transfer function, including the sampling action of these four blocks, is (ignoring C2 )` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Simplified open-loop transfer function for continuous-time PLL system analysis with Holder Function]].
- `GOL (s) is converted to GOL (z)` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 59)
	[[Simplified open-loop transfer function from continuous-time (s domain) to discrete-time (z domain)]]
- `closed-loop gain of the system` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 59)
	[[Simplified closed-loop transfer function for discrete-time PLL system analysis]].
- `Now the poles of (3.35) are given by` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Poles of the simplified closed-loop transfer function for discrete-time PLL system analysis]].
- `Taking this expression and substituting back in for K and a, the critical period for which the loop will go unstable, TUS` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Critical value at which the reference period (low frequency) cannot achieve to make the system unstable, making any pole move outside the unit circle]].
- `where vref_crt , the reference frequency at which the loop goes unstable` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 61)
	[[Stability relationship between PLL response frequency and reference signal reference]].
- `A ratio often quoted as being `safe` is 10:1` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 61) Important.

### Ô∏èüî∂ Explanation
- `The preceding linear, continuous-time analysis of the synthesizer is not valid under all conditions. If the loop bandwidth is increased so that it becomes a significant fraction of the reference frequency, the previous analyses become increasingly inaccurate.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Increased loop bandwidth makes continuous-time analysis inaccurate]].

- `For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to treat the synthesizer system as the discrete-time control system that it truly is [5].` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Increased loop bandwidth synthesizer system truly is a discrete-time control system]].
- `To do this, we must consider the PFD, which in this case is the sampling element. We assume that, in lock, the PFD produces only narrow impulses at the reference frequency.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Synthesizer system as a discrete-time control system]].
- `Note that because the charge pump behaves like an integrator, it has infinite gain at dc.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Charge pump has infinite gain because it's behaves like an integrator]].

- `Thus, as long as the frequency deviation is small, this high gain drives the phase error towards zero, and the output pulses will be narrow. Therefore, it acts like an ideal sampler.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Charge pump high gain drives phase error to zero]].

- `The point of greatest interest here is that point at which the reference period is increased to some critical value and the system becomes unstable, as one of the poles moves outside the unit circle. At, or even close to, this period, the s domain analysis discussed in the previous section will be increasingly inaccurate.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Critical value at which the reference period (low frequency) cannot achieve to make the system unstable, making any pole move outside the unit circle]] -
- `The pole that has the larger positive value is not of concern because it will never leave the unit circle.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Positive pole of the transfer function of a simple PLL will never leave the unit circle]].
- `However, it is of interest to find out when` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 60)
	[[Critical value of the negative pole of simple closed-loop PLL transfer function]].
