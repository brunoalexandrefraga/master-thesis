### 📌 Vocabulary
- `dumped onto` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	To dump onto (p.v.) - To release, deposit, or pour something onto a surface or object, often in a large or uncontrolled manner.

### 💡 Technical concepts
- `loop bandwidth` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Loop bandwidth]] - Frequency range in which the loop can effectively follow the reference.
- `hold function` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Hold function]] - Process that maintains a signal or value for a certain period of time without change.

### 🈂️ Translate
- `so that` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[...] de forma que.
- `frequency deviation` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	Desvio de frequência.
- `towards` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[...] em direção a.

### ✅️ Important
- `The loop filter holds the charge dumped onto it in each cycle, so, in this system, it acts as a hold function.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58) Important.
- `open-loop transfer function, including the sampling action of these four blocks, is (ignoring C2 )` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Simplified open-loop transfer function for discrete-time PLL system analysis]].
- `closed-loop gain of the system` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 59)
	[[Simplified closed-loop transfer function for discrete-time PLL system analysis]].

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `The preceding linear, continuous-time analysis of the synthesizer is not valid under all conditions. If the loop bandwidth is increased so that it becomes a significant fraction of the reference frequency, the previous analyses become increasingly inaccurate.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Increased loop bandwidth makes continuous-time analysis inaccurate]].

- `For this reason, it is sometimes necessary to treat the synthesizer system as the discrete-time control system that it truly is [5].` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Increased loop bandwidth synthesizer system truly is a discrete-time control system]].
- `To do this, we must consider the PFD, which in this case is the sampling element. We assume that, in lock, the PFD produces only narrow impulses at the reference frequency.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Synthesizer system as a discrete-time control system]].
- `Note that because the charge pump behaves like an integrator, it has infinite gain at dc.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Charge pump has infinite gain because it's behaves like an integrator]].

- `Thus, as long as the frequency deviation is small, this high gain drives the phase error towards zero, and the output pulses will be narrow. Therefore, it acts like an ideal sampler.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[[Charge pump high gain drives phase error to zero]].
