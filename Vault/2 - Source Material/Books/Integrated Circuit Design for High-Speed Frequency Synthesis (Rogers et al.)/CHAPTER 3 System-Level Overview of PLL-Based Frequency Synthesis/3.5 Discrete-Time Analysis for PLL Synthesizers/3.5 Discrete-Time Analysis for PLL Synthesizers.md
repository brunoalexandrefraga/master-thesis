## 🔗 Notes (Zotero)
### 📌 Vocabulary


### 💡 Technical concepts
- `loop bandwidth` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Loop bandwidth]] - Frequency range in which the loop can effectively follow the reference.

### 🈂️ Translate
- `so that` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 58)
	[...] de forma que.

### ✅️ Important
- `If the loop bandwidth is increased so that it becomes a significantfraction of the reference frequency, the previous analyses become increasinglyinaccurate.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 73)
	[[Increased loop bandwidth makes continuous-time analysis inaccurate]].
