### ✅️ Important
- `An integer-N PLL is the simplest type of phase-locked loop synthesizer` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
	[[Integer-N PLL]], [[Phase-Locked Loop]].
- `divide by a fraction (fractional-N), essentially by switching between two or more integer values such that the effective divider ratio is a fraction.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
	[[Fractional-N PLL]].
- `The PLL-based synthesizer is a feedback system that compares the phase of a reference fr to the phase of a divided-down output of a controllable signal source ffb , also known as a voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO).` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
