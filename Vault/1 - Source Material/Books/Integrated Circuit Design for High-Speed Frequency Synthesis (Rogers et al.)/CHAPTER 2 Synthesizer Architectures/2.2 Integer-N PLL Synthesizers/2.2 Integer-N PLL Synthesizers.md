### ✅️ Important
- `An integer-N PLL is the simplest type of phase-locked loop synthesizer` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
	[[Integer-N PLL]], [[Phase-Locked Loop]].
- `divide by a fraction (fractional-N), essentially by switching between two or more integer values such that the effective divider ratio is a fraction.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
	[[Fractional-N PLL]].
- `PLL-based synthesizers areamong the most common ways to implement synthesizers` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32) Important.
- `The PLL-based synthesizer is a feedback system that compares the phase of a reference fr to the phase of a divided-down output of a controllable signal source ffb , also known as a voltagecontrolled oscillator (VCO).` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 17)
	[[PLL-based synthesizer]].
- `The summing block in the feedback is commonlycalled a phase detector.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32)
	[[PLL Summing block]], [[PLL Phase detector]].
- `Through feedback, the loop forces the phase of the signalsource to track the phase of the feedback signal;` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32) Important.
- `Thus, the output frequency, which is a multiple of the feedback signal, is given byfo = N ? fref` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32) Important.
- `Due to divider implementation details, it is not easy to make a divider thatdivides by noninteger values. Thus, a PLL synthesizer of this type is called aninteger-N frequency synthesizer.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32) Important.
- `Since N is an integer, the minimum step size of this synthesizer is equal to thereference frequency fr.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 33) Important.

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `therefore, their frequencies mustbe equal` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 32)
