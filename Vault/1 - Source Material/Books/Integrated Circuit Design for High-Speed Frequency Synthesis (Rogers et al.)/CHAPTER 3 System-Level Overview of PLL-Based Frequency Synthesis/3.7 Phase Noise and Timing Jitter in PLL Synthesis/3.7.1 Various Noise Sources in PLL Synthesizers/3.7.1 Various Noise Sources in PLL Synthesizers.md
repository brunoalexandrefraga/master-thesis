### ‚úÖÔ∏è Important
- `Noise in resistors is generated by thermal energy causing random electron motion.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Thermal energy in resistor that causes random electron motion]].
- `Noise in active devices can be thermal channel noise, 1/f noise, or shot noise` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Noise in active devices]].
- `Noise can also be coupled into the circuit under test through electromagnetic coupling from other circuits or external noise sources` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Noise by electromagnetic coupling from external noise sources]].
- `Noise can also be injected through the substrate due to a combination of capacitive and conductive coupling from other circuits on the same die` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Noise injected through the substrate due to a combination of capacitive and conductive coupling from other circuits on the same die]].
- `phase noise from a VCO` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Phase noise from a VCO]].
- `Thus, at most frequencies of interest, the phase noise produced by the VCO will go down at 20 dB/dec as we move away from the carrier.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91)
	[[The 20 dB per dec rule of the VCO phase noise]].
- `The total noise PSD of a crystal oscillator can be found by Leeson's formula` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91)
	[[Total noise PSD of a crystal oscillator]].
- `Frequency dividers consist of switching logic circuits, which are sensitive to clock timing jitter.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91) Important.
- `Time jitter or phase noise occurs when rising and falling edges of digital dividers are superimposed with spurious signals, such as thermal noise and flicker noise in semiconductor materials.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91) Important.
- `Frequency dividers generate spurious noise especially for high-frequency operation.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91) Important.
- `Dividers do not generate signals; rather, they simply change their frequency.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91) Important.
- `Kroupa provided an empirical formula that describes the amount of phase noise that frequency dividers add to a signal` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91)
	[[Empirical formula that describes the amount of phase noise that frequency dividers add to a signal]]
- `At large offsets, phase detectors generate a white phase noise floor of about -160 dBc/Hz, which is thermal noise dominant.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92) Important.
- `noise PSD of phase detectors` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92)
	[[Noise PSD of phase detectors (PFD)]].
- `Note that, at this point in the loop, the phase is represented by the current.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92) Important.
- `The most common loop filter that has been examined in this chapter will now be analyzed. It contains only one noise source, the thermal noise associated with R.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92) Important.
- `Now, the noise voltage develops a current flowing through the series combination of C1 , C2 , and R` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92)
	[[Noise current generated by the resistor of a second-order loop filter of a PLL]].

### Ô∏èüî∂ Explanation
- `VCO phase noise is usually dominant outside the loop bandwidth and of less importance at low offset frequencies.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 91)
	What is "outside the loop bandwidth"?
- `Phase detectors experience both flicker and thermal noise.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92)
	It occurs because the PFD also deal with low frequency signals.
- `The charge pump output current noise can be a strong function of the frequency and of the width of the current pulses; therefore, for low noise operation, it is desirable to keep the charge pump currents matched as well as possible. This is because current sources only produce noise when they are on. In an ideal loop, when locked, the charge pump is always off.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 92)
