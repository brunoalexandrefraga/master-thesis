## 🔗 Notes (Zotero)
### 💡 Technical concepts


### ✅️ Important
- `The noise transfer functions for the various noise sources in the loop can be derived quite easily using the theory already presented. There are two noise transfer functions: one for the VCO and one for all other sources of noise in the loop.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `All noise generated by the PFD, charge pump, divider, and loop filter is referred back to the input` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `noise from the VCO is referred to the output` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93) Important.
- `The transfer function for wnoise I (s) has already been derived` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 93)
	[[Transfer function for noise from PFD, charge pump, divider and loop filter]].
- `transfer function for the noise due to the VCO is slightly different` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 94)
	[[Transfer function for noise from VCO]].

### ️🔶 Explanation
- `This is a highpass filter. Thus, at low offsets inside the loop bandwidth, the VCO noise is suppressed by the feedback action of the loop. Outside the loop bandwidth, however, the VCO is essentially free running; thus, the loop noise approaches the VCO noise.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 94)
