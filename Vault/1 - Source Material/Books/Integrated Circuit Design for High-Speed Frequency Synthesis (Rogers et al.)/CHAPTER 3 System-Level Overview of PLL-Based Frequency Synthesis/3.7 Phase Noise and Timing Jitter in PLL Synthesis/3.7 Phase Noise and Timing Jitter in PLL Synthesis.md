### ‚úÖÔ∏è Important
- `We are primarily concerned with noise that causes fluctuations in the phase of the output, rather than noise that causes amplitude fluctuations in the tone, since the output typically has a fixed, limited amplitude.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87) Important.
- `output signal of a synthesizer` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Generic output signal of a synthesizer with random fluctuations in the phase of the output]].
- `the phase noise in an oscillator, which is mainly due to thermal, flicker, or 1/f noise and the finite Q of the oscillator tank` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87) Important.
- `The phase fluctuation is assumed to have a sinusoidal` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Phase fluctuation equation]].
- `small phase fluctuation` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	[[Small phase fluctuation equation in a PLL]].
- `often phase noise is reported relative to the carrier power` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[Typical expression for phase noise relative to the carrier power]].
- `In this form, phase noise has units of rad2/Hz.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `To further complicate this, both singlesideband (SSB) and double-sideband phase noise can be defined.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `SSB phase noise is defined as the ratio of power in one sideband per hertz of bandwidth, at an offset Dv away from the carrier, to the total signal power.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88) Important.
- `The SSB phase noise power spectral density (PSD) to carrier ratio, in units of [dBc/Hz]` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
	[[SSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]].
- `Note that SSB phase noise is by far the most common type reported, and, often, it is not specified as SSB but simply reported as phase noise.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89) Important.
- `double-sideband phase noise` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[DSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]].
- `From either the SSB or double-sideband phase noise, the rms jitter can be obtained as` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[Math definition of RMS jitter]].
- `The rms integrated phase noise of a synthesizer is given by` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[RMS integrated phase noise of a synthesizer]].
- `The limits of integration are usually the offsets corresponding to the lower and upper frequencies of the bandwidth of the information being transmitted.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89) Important.
- `In addition, it should be noted that dividing or multiplying a signal in the time domain also multiplies or divides the phase noise. Thus, if a signal is translated in frequency by a factor of N, then the phase noise is related by` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 89)
	[[Division or multiplication of signal in the time domain also multiplying or dividing the phase noise]].
- `Phase noise reading is thus dependent on the resolution bandwidth (RBW), which is the IF filter bandwidth, in a spectrum analyzer. For example, a phase noise reading of -100 dBc with an RBW of 10 Hz in a spectrum analyzer would be -90 dBc with another RBW setting of 100 Hz.` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 90)
	[[Dependency of Resolution bandwidth in phase noise reading of a spectrum analyzer]].

### Ô∏èüî∂ Explanation
- `Synthesizer noise performance is usually classified in terms of phase noise` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 86)
	The phase noise is a measure of how much the output diverges from an ideal impulse function in the frequency domain.
- `The discrete spurs at a synthesizer output are most likely due to the fractional-N mechanism` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 87)
	Due to the existance of spurious tones to the nonlinearities, I guess.
- `It is now evident that the phase-modulated signal includes the carrier signal tone and two symmetric sidebands at any offset frequency` (Rogers et al., 2006, p. 88)
