## ‚úçÔ∏è Core Idea  
A clear sentence that summarizes the central insight or purpose of the note.  
> *Example:* The transfer function of a basic Integer-N PLL can be expressed as a first-order system.

## üß© Development

### 1. Context  
Brief description of the system, circuit, or problem being analyzed.  
> *Example:* Linearized model of an Integer-N PLL for frequency-domain analysis.

### 2. Derivation / Analysis  
As what was obtained in [[DSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]] and [[SSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]], it's possible to get the rms jitter as
$$
\varphi_\text{rms}\left(\Delta\omega\right)=\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{DSB}\left(\Delta\omega\right)}{10}}=\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{SSB}\left(\Delta\omega\right)}{10}}
$$
And it's measured in $\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. If it's desired to measure the rms jitter in deg, it can use the following relation
$$
\varphi_\text{rms}\left(\Delta f\right)=\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{DSB}\left(\Delta f\right)}{10}}=\frac{180^\circ\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\cdot\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{SSB}\left(\Delta f\right)}{10}}
$$




### 3. Example (optional)  
Include a practical case, numerical example, or simulation result to reinforce understanding.
