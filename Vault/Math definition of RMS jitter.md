As what was obtained in [[DSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]] and [[SSB phase noise PSD to carrier ratio]], it's possible to get the rms jitter as
$$
\varphi_\text{rms}\left(\Delta\omega\right)=\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{DSB}\left(\Delta\omega\right)}{10}}=\sqrt{2}\cdot\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{SSB}\left(\Delta\omega\right)}{10}}
$$
And it's measured in $\text{rad}/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$. If it's desired to measure the rms jitter in deg, it can use the following relation
$$
\varphi_\text{rms}\left(\Delta f\right)=\frac{180^\circ}{\pi}\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{DSB}\left(\Delta f\right)}{10}}=\frac{180^\circ\sqrt{2}}{\pi}\cdot\sqrt{10^\frac{\text{PN}_\text{SSB}\left(\Delta f\right)}{10}}
$$
