The math definition of phase noise from a VCO is
$$
\varphi_\text{VCO}^2\left(\Delta\omega\right)=\frac{C}{\Delta\omega^2}+D
$$
where $C$ is a constant of proportionality, and v is the frequency offset from the carrier. The constant $D$ is a lower limit imposed by thermal noise on phase noise, which, for the most integrated VCOs, is somewhere $-120\sim-150\;\text{dBc}/\text{Hz}$.

To make the analysis of the phase noise of a VCO easier, [[The 20 dB per dec rule of the VCO phase noise]] can be used.
