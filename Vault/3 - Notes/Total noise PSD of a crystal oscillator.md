The total noise PSD of a crystal oscillator can be found by Leesonâ€™s formula
$$
\varphi_\text{x}^2\left(\Delta\omega\right)=10^{-16\pm1}\cdot\left[1+\left(\frac{\omega_0}{2\Delta\omega\cdot Q_L}\right)^2\right]\left(1+\frac{\omega_c}{\Delta\omega}\right)
$$
where $\omega_0$ is the oscillator output frequency; $\omega_c$ is the [[Corner frequency]] between $1/f$ and [[Thermal noise region]], which is normally in the range of $1\sim10\;\text{kHz}$; and $Q_L$ is the loaded [[Quality factor]] of the resonator.
