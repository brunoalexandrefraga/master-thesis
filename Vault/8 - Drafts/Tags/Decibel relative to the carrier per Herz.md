## 📚 Definition  
In the context of phase noise, the unit dBc/Hz stands for decibels relative to the carrier per Hertz. It's a unit used to express how much power noise power exists in a certain frequency offset from the carrier signal, normalized per 1 Hz of bandwidth.

## 🧠 Key Characteristics  
- List the most important properties or features.
- Useful for quick review or comparisons.

> *Example:*  
- Integer division only  
- High spurious tones due to fixed step size

## 📖 Applications  
Where and how this concept is used in real-world systems or research.

> *Example:*  
- Used in RF transceivers  
- Clock generation in SoCs  
- Baseband frequency synthesis

## 🧩 Examples (optional)  
If a signal has a phase noise of **-90 dBc/Hz** at a 10 kHz offset, it means:
> The noise power measured in a 1 Hz bandwidth at 10 kHz away from the carrier is 90 dB below the carrier power.
