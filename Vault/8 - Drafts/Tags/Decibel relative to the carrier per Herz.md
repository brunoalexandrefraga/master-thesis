In the context of phase noise, the unit $\text{dBc}/\text{Hz}$ stands for decibels relative to the carrier per Hertz. It's a unit used to express how much power noise power exists in a certain frequency offset from the carrier signal, normalized per 1 Hz of bandwidth.

If a signal has a phase noise of $-90\;\text{dBc}/\text{Hz}$ at a 10 kHz offset, it means:
> The noise power measured in a 1 Hz bandwidth at 10 kHz away from the carrier is 90 dB below the carrier power.
