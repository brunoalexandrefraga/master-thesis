## 📚 Definition  
A clear and concise explanation of the concept.  
> *Example:* An Integer-N PLL is a type of frequency synthesizer where the feedback divider is constrained to integer values, resulting in frequency steps equal to the reference frequency.

## 🧠 Key Characteristics  
- List the most important properties or features.
- Useful for quick review or comparisons.

> *Example:*  
- Integer division only  
- High spurious tones due to fixed step size  
- Simpler architecture than fractional-N PLLs
