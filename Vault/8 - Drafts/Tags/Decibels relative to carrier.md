## 📚 Definition  
The unit **dBc** stands for **decibels relative to carrier**. It's a unit to express the power level of a signal relative to the power of a carrier signal.
The mathematically definition of this technical concept is
$$
\text{dBc}=10\cdot\log\left(\frac{P}{P_c}\right)
$$
where $P$ is the power of the signal being measured (e.g. noise, spurious tone, sideband, etc.) and $P_c$ is the power of the main carrier signal.
