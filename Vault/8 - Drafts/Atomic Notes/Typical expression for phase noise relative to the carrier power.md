A spectrum analyzer measures the phase noise power in dBm/Hz, but often phase noise is reported relative to the carrier power as
$$
\varphi_n^2\left(\Delta\omega\right)=\frac{N\left(\omega_\text{LO}+\Delta\omega\right)}{P_c\left(\omega_\text{LO}\right)}
$$
where $N$ is the noise power in a 1-Hz bandwidth, and $P_c$ is the power of the carrier or $\text{LO}$ (Local Oscillator) tone at the frequency at which the synthesizer is operating. In  this form, phase noise has units of $\text{rad}^2/\text{Hz}$.
