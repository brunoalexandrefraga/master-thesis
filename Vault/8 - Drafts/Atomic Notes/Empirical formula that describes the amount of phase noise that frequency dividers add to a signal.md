Kroupa provided an empirical formula that describes the amount of phase noise that frequency dividers add to a signal
$$
\varphi_N^2\left(\Delta\omega\right)\approx\frac{10^{-14\pm1}+10^{-27\pm1}\omega_\text{oN}}{2\pi\cdot\Delta\omega}+10^{-16\pm1}+\frac{10^{-22\pm1}\omega_\text{oN}}{2\pi}
$$
where $\omega_\text{oN}$ is the divider output frequency, and $\Delta\omega$ the offset frequency. Notice that the first term in (3.74) represents the flicker noise and the second term gives the white thermal-noise floor. The third term is caused by timing jitter due to coupling and ambient and supply variations.
