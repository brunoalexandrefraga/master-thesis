## ✍️ Core Idea  
A clear sentence that summarizes the central insight or purpose of the note.  
> *Example:* The transfer function of a basic Integer-N PLL can be expressed as a first-order system.

---

## 🧩 Development

### 1. Context  
Brief description of the system, circuit, or problem being analyzed.  
> *Example:* Linearized model of an Integer-N PLL for frequency-domain analysis.

### 2. Derivation / Analysis  
Given the results gotten from [[PLL phase-modulated signal including the carrier signal tone and two symmetric sidebands at any offset frequency]],from the [[Power]] definition ,
$$
P_c(\omega_\text{LO})=\frac{1}{2}V_0^2
$$




### 3. Example (optional)  
Include a practical case, numerical example, or simulation result to reinforce understanding.
