A Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) is a circuit that generates a signal based on a reference signal. The circuit of a PLL is responsible for synchronizing the generated signal with the reference signal, even if the new signal is at a different frequency.

- Generate a new signal based on a reference signal;
- The generated signal can be at a different frequency of reference.

The PLL circuit is highly used in **radiofrequency (RF) transceivers**. In these devices, the PLL is responsible for allowing a wide range of frequencies to be selected (for transmission and reception).

Another use of PLL is on clock generation for digital devices, as it's the case of processors, microcontrollers and memory interfaces. These devices have their operations managed and synchronized by this clock signal. Therefore, the signal must be highly stable and precise.
